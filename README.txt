The CODE directory will have the following:
===========================================

*.c -> All .c source files.

*.h -> Any optional header files.

Makefile -> With commands: make and make clean. make should produce both 'server' and 'client' executables separately.

Executable -> Statically linked executables of your Client and Server implementations. Try running it on multiple computers to check its portability.
